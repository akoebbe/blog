Summary: I'd never heard of lotion bars before finding this recipe, but I'm sold after using these bars over the past year. They are especially helpful overnight.

I'd never heard of lotion bars before finding this recipe, but I'm sold after using these bars over the past year. They are especially helpful overnight.

I originally found this recipe on [One Good Thing by Jillee](http://www.onegoodthingbyjillee.com/2012/04/make-your-own-lotion-bars.html), but like most recipes I'm finding the ingredients were not clearly listed in mass (grams). So I've converted the measurements and simplified the ratio to 1:1:1 just to make it easy to remember.

## Ingredients
- 60g beeswax
- 60g coconut oil
- 60g shea butter
- Essential oils (optional)

## Directions
1. Double boil or microwave all ingredients until melted
2. Pour in to soap forms or any form you have around. I've used I use a [silicone brownie bite tray](http://www.amazon.com/Wilton-2105-4923-24-Cavity-Silicone-Brownie/dp/B001T4URXG) for travel size.
